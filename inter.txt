agile enviroment

book:
how to win frineds influence by dale carnegie

what is being Tested:
->ability to solve problem 
->ability to use programming language
->ability to perform under pressure

basic:

read the problem completely
solve the problem manually
optimize the manual steps
write the manual steps(Pseudo-code)
replace the comments or pesudo code with real code
optimize the real code
 
our problem:

reading the problem:
->completely twice
->solve Manually
->optimize the manual steps(pattern or loops)
->pseudo-code

psueo-code:
add comments
add mapping

->manual steps and rewrite as comments
//split the title into spaces
//capatilize word[0]
//capatalize word[last]
//for each word from word[1] to word[last-1]
//if list contais the word
//lower cases the word
  //else
     //capatilize the word

//combine into word


optimize the code:

->code is easily redeable and understandable

practicing(code-site):

topcoder
codility
projectEuler
